### Before running the app

This repository relies on having mongodb running locally. You can start it with:

```bash
# first check to see if mongo is already running
docker ps | grep mongodb

# if not, start it
docker run --restart unless-stopped --name mongodb -p 27017:27017 -d percona/percona-server-mongodb:7.0 --replSet rs0
```

Reference instructions for [setting up docker](https://docs.tax.service.gov.uk/mdtp-handbook/documentation/developer-set-up/install-docker.html) and [running mongodb](https://docs.tax.service.gov.uk/mdtp-handbook/documentation/developer-set-up/set-up-mongodb.html#install-mongodb-applesilicon-mac).

## Running the app

### Service manager
The whole service can be started with:
```bash
sm2 --start DISA_RETURNS_ALL
```

### Locally

```bash
sbt run
```

To run locally with HMRC-style test-only routes enabled:

```bash
sbt run -Dapplication.router=testOnlyDoNotUseInAppConf.Routes
```

If starting through service-manager, pass the same JVM parameter in the local service profile:

```bash
-Dapplication.router=testOnlyDoNotUseInAppConf.Routes
```

### Performance tests

Run with test-only routes and extended Z-references:

```bash
sbt -Dapplication.router=testOnlyDoNotUseInAppConf.Routes -Dfeatures.strict-z-reference-validation-enabled=false run
```

The following test-only routes are available only with that router:

- `GET /disa-returns-submission/test-only/overrides/:zReference`
- `PUT /disa-returns-submission/test-only/overrides`
- `POST /disa-returns-submission/test-only/overrides/delete`
- `POST /disa-returns-submission/test-only/monthly-returns`

Production monthly-return and reporting-window routes require an internal-auth token. Local Bruno requests use:

```text
Authorization: valid-internal-auth-token-disa-returns-backend
```

That token must exist in local internal-auth with `READ` and `WRITE` permissions for `disa-returns-submission/*`.
The test-only routes above remain unauthenticated.

Enabling this router also changes dependency bindings. `TimeSource` and `ReportingWindowService` are bound to
aggregate-backed test implementations. Production monthly-return and reporting-window
status routes therefore observe test-only clock and reporting-window overrides while this router is active. With the
normal router, they use `SystemClock` and the configured declaration-period boundaries only and never query overrides.

Z-references are canonically uppercased using `Locale.ROOT`. Utilities that previously normalized references continue
to trim them before validation. By default a valid reference is `Z` followed by exactly four digits. Setting
`features.strict-z-reference-validation-enabled=false` uses loose validation that accepts four to eight digits instead. Persisted overrides are
keyed by the canonical value, so `z1234` and `Z1234` address the same state.

The production reporting-window status route remains available for the effective status of a normalized Z-reference:

```text
GET /disa-returns-submission/reporting-window/status/:zReference
```

It requires the `READ` permission, returns `200 OK` with a `reportingWindowOpen` boolean for a valid Z-reference, and
returns `400 Bad Request` for an invalid Z-reference. With the test-only router it observes the aggregate override.

### Aggregate overrides

Use `PUT /disa-returns-submission/test-only/overrides` to apply the same full replacement to every supplied Z-reference:

```json
{
  "zReferences": ["Z1234", "Z5678"],
  "clock": {
    "date": "2026-05-17"
  },
  "reportingWindow": {
    "startDate": "2026-05-16T23:59:00Z",
    "endDate": "2026-05-17T00:01:00Z"
  }
}
```

Both override fields are optional. Because PUT is a full replacement, omitting either field clears that field for every
reference; a body containing only `zReferences` clears both.
The clock date is applied at `00:00:00Z`. The reporting-window interval is inclusive and `startDate` must be before or
equal to `endDate`. `zReferences` must be a non-empty array; values are trimmed, uppercased and de-duplicated, and any
invalid reference or body returns `400` before any write occurs. Repository failures return `503`.

Successful PUT returns `204`. Single-reference GET returns `200` with this flat shape:

```json
{
  "zReference": "Z1234",
  "clock": { "date": "2026-05-17" },
  "reportingWindow": {
    "startDate": "2026-05-16T23:59:00Z",
    "endDate": "2026-05-17T00:01:00Z"
  }
}
```

Absent fields are returned as `null`. `POST /disa-returns-submission/test-only/overrides/delete` accepts
`{"zReferences":["Z1234","Z5678"]}`, removes all matching aggregates, and returns `204`.
The override endpoint only reports configured overrides; use the production reporting-window status endpoint for the
effective status. Submission processing uses `SystemClock` when the aggregate clock is absent or expired, and the
configured declaration-period boundaries when its reporting window is absent. The complete persistence document is
keyed by normalized Z-reference in one `testOverrides` MongoDB collection and expires after `testOverrideTtlHours`,
which defaults to one hour. Repository reads reject expired documents immediately, before MongoDB's TTL cleanup runs.

Monthly-return creation and declaration resolve the effective instant and reporting-window state once, then use that
same instant for both previous-month validation and window evaluation.

### Submission and declaration contract

`POST /disa-returns-submission/monthly/:zReference/:taxYear/:month/declarations` returns `422` with code
`MONTHLY_RETURN_ALREADY_DECLARED` for a duplicate declaration, or `DECLARATION_PERIOD_CLOSED` when the reporting window
is closed. These code values form the backend mapping contract.

Declarations can register submissions whose data is still being transferred:

```json
{
  "nilReturn": false,
  "pendingSubmissionIds": [
    "consumer-generated-submission-id"
  ]
}
```

`pendingSubmissionIds` is optional and defaults to an empty list. It cannot be supplied when `nilReturn` is `true`.
Pending submissions are recorded with `CREATED` status.

Submission data is transferred with:

```text
PUT /disa-returns-submission/monthly/:zReference/:taxYear/:month/submissions/:submissionId
Content-Type: application/x-ndjson
```

A successful PUT updates an existing `CREATED` submission, or creates a missing submission before declaration, with
`STORED` status. A `CREATED` submission remains uploadable after declaration. An already `STORED` submission, or an
unknown submission after declaration, returns `409 Conflict`.

For example, set the clock to `2026-06-17` to create and declare May 2026 monthly returns inside the configured declaration period, or `2026-06-20` to test declaration attempts outside the configured declaration period.

Use `POST` to clear monthly returns for specific Z-references from the submission service local database:

```bash
curl -X POST \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"zReferences":["Z1234","Z5678"]}' \
  http://localhost:12103/disa-returns-submission/test-only/monthly-returns
```

`zReferences` must be a non-empty JSON array. References are trimmed, uppercased, and de-duplicated; any invalid
reference returns `400` without deleting records. The route deletes only returns belonging to the supplied references,
returns `204` on success and `503` on repository failure, and must not run concurrently with return creation for those
references.

You can then query the app to ensure it is working with the following command:

```bash
# other useful commands
sbt clean

sbt reload

sbt compile
```

### Running the test suite

To run the unit tests:

```bash
sbt test
```

To run the integration tests:

```bash
sbt it/test
```

### Test-Only Endpoints

Test-only endpoints require the service to be running with `-Dapplication.router=testOnlyDoNotUseInAppConf.Routes`.
Otherwise the routes will not be available.

| Endpoint | Used by | Purpose and response |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GET /disa-returns-submission/test-only/overrides/:zReference` | `bruno/TestOnly/Overrides` | Return the configured aggregate fields. |
| `PUT /disa-returns-submission/test-only/overrides` | `bruno/TestOnly/Overrides` | Bulk replace aggregates and return `204`. |
| `POST /disa-returns-submission/test-only/overrides/delete` | `bruno/TestOnly/Overrides` | Bulk delete aggregates and return `204`. |
| `POST /disa-returns-submission/test-only/monthly-returns` | `bruno/TestOnly/MonthlyReturns`, performance tests | Delete monthly returns only for supplied normalized, de-duplicated references and return `204`; reject missing, empty, or invalid input with `400`. |

The `ReportingWindow/01-200-status-open-by-override` Bruno journey creates one aggregate, verifies the production status
route, and deletes the aggregate. The test-only override folder covers GET, bulk replacement, omitted-field clearing,
bulk deletion, and invalid interval behavior.
